# Playing with GraphQL

This is a personal experiment, my first contact with graphQL both from the frontend and the Backend perspective. 

Backend is built in node.js-express.js and moongoose/mongoDB.
Based on This Tutorial: [https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-set-up-a-graphql-server-using-node-js-express-mongodb-52421b73f474]

Frontend is built in Angular 7 and ngMaterial

## Install Dependencies

Enter in frontend and backend folder and run 

```bash
npm install
```

## Backend

Before launching backend, we need to run our mongo database.

### Windows

1. Navigate to mongoDB installation folder _(default: C:\Users\amadia\mongoDB\MongoDB\Server\4.0)_
2. Run `mongodb` in the command line

Once MongoDB is running, we can launch our backend using the folowing command:
```bash
npm start
```

### Linux

1. Using this commands we can control MongoDB
* Check Status:
```bash
sudo systemctl status mongodb
```
* MongoDB Data
```bash
mongo --eval 'db.runCommand({ connectionStatus: 1 })'
```
* Start, stop or restart mongoDB Service
```bash
sudo systemctl start mongodb
sudo systemctl stop mongodb
sudo systemctl restart mongodb
```
By default, MongoDB is configured to start automatically with the server. If you wish to disable the automatic startup, type:
```bash
sudo systemctl disable mongodb
```
Itâ€™s just as easy to enable it again. To do this, use:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable mongodb
```

### Launch Backend
